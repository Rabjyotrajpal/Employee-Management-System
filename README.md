<u><b>INTRODUCTION </b></u> <br>
Employee management is a practice that helps a manager improve 
employee productivity and satisfaction to help an organisation reach 
its goals. Human resources (HR) professionals often use an employee 
management system (EMS), including recruitment, offboarding and 
performance management. Using a dedicated EMS can help an HR 
manager streamline the hiring process and improve workplace 
efficiency.
