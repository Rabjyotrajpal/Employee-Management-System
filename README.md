# Employee-Management-System
INTRODUCTION
Employee management is a practice that helps a manager improve 
employee productivity and satisfaction to help an organisation reach 
its goals. Human resources (HR) professionals often use an employee 
management system (EMS), including recruitment, offboarding and 
performance management. Using a dedicated EMS can help an HR 
manager streamline the hiring process and improve workplace 
efficiency.
Employee Management system is an application-based program, 
having 4 sub tasks:
• To remove an employee
• To display the list of employees
• To add an employee
• To search for an employee in the list
Every organisation, be it schools, governments, offices etc, use an 
employee management system to keep track of the employees. This 
employee system keeps data secured and updated for future 
reference. The program is written in Python language and utilises 
MySQL database to store the data and access it.
